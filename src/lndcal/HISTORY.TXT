1. removed production date rule in determining recalibration for TM data.
2. recalibration is now determined by RE_CAL flag (in lndcal*.txt) only 
   (default = flase)
3. load gnew and gold data only if RE_CAL=true (or yes)

1. fixed bugs that caused incompatible problems across different C compilers 
   for lndcal and lndsr (some variables need to be initilized first)
2. compiled and tested in 64-bit Linux system under 32-bit mode

1. fixed a bug in processing pixel with one or more band is missing 
   (uses fill value for all bands if one is missing) 
2. revised Makefile and forces code to be compiled in 32-bit (-m32) 
3. fixed a bug in using zero array in space.c 
   (can't be compiled for some compilers)

1. received original "lndcal" ledaps version from TK Lim and revised
   this version into two modes: public and ledaps
2. added option for re-calibration in "lndcal" input file
   do not run re-calibration (public mode) if RE_CAL="NO" or RE_CAL="FALSE"
   run re-calibration (default or ledaps mode) if RE_CAL="YES" or RE_CAL="TRUE"
3. added processing on saturated pixels (use 20000 as saturateValue)
4. used gain and bias from metedata as input for all sensors (MSS, TM, ETM+)
   under public mode (RE_CAL="NO"), otherwise run in ledaps mode as default.
